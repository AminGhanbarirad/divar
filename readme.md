Hello there! I'm excited to share my experience with the Python for Everybody Specialization from the University of Michigan on Coursera and the crawling project I undertook using the knowledge gained from the specialization.

Firstly, the specialization provided a solid foundation in Python programming, web scraping, and data handling, which proved to be instrumental in developing my crawling project. I chose to focus on Iran's biggest Second Hand Online Shop, "Divar," to investigate the impact of immigration-related mental factors on the pricing of household items, particularly refrigerators.

Project Overview:
Objective: To analyze the pricing trends of refrigerators tagged as "Household Items for SALE due to IMMIGRATION ONLY" on Divar.

Steps Taken:

Web Scraping: Utilized Python's web scraping libraries, such as Beautiful Soup and requests, to extract relevant information from Divar's website. This included details like product title, description, price, and tags.

Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the scraped data to ensure consistency and accuracy. This step involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing the format of the information.

Future ideas for project development :

Data Analysis: Leveraged Pandas and Matplotlib for data analysis. I focused on identifying trends in refrigerator prices among ads specifically tagged with "Household Items for SALE due to IMMIGRATION ONLY."

Visualization: Created visualizations, such as price distribution histograms, to provide a clear representation of the data. This helped in identifying any patterns or anomalies in the pricing process influenced by immigration-related factors.

Insights: Analyzed the findings to draw conclusions on how immigration-related mental impacts might affect the pricing of refrigerators. This could involve assessing whether sellers tend to lower prices due to urgency or emotional reasons associated with immigration.

Challenges Faced:

Dynamic Website Structure: Divar's website structure might change, posing challenges in maintaining the web scraping script's reliability.
Tag Accuracy: The accuracy of the "Household Items for SALE due to IMMIGRATION ONLY" tag needed validation to ensure the relevance of the analyzed data.
Next Steps:

Expand Analysis: Extend the analysis to other household items, not just refrigerators, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the pricing dynamics.
Sentiment Analysis: Incorporate sentiment analysis to gauge the emotional context in the ad descriptions and understand the impact on pricing.
This project not only allowed me to apply the skills learned in the specialization but also provided valuable insights into the intersection of human psychology, life events like immigration, and the second-hand market. It showcased the real-world applicability of Python programming and data analysis in unraveling interesting patterns from online platforms.
